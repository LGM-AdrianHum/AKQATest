# AKQATest

##Notes and Changes

1. Configuration file. 
 * Host entries
 * Location of logging file.
2. WCF or RESTful Contracts.
3. CORS Configuration simpler.

##Installation

None... just load and run the test site.
Swagger ... used Swashbuckler, so just installed; it does it all.

##Choices
The service did not need a huge amount of scaffolding, so a simple webforms with ajax call is more than enough. React or angular would have been overkill.
